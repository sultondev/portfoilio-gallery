Comments for testers:

I did use vite instead of CRA because it boosts the proccess of developing. But I can use CRA, either.

Also I did use [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) instead of Redux. Because it's faster than Redux and Recoil JS belongs to Facebook.

I didn't use Redux because Dan Abramov and other many developers said it's not required to use.
